# 1.1.7 Datasheets

## Overview

Datasheets are technical documents published by component manufacturers. Engineers use them to identify electronic components, determine pin connections, understand operating limits, interpret timing specifications, and select appropriate parts for a design.

In this assignment, you will practice locating and interpreting manufacturer datasheets for common digital-electronics integrated circuits. You will also identify unfamiliar part numbers, logic-gate packages, and integrated-circuit package styles.

While there are many resources available for finding IC datasheets, one of the best you can use is [alldatasheet.com](https://www.alldatasheet.com/).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

- Locate a manufacturer datasheet for an electronic component.
- Identify connection diagrams, function tables, and key electrical specifications.
- Determine the function and manufacturer of an unfamiliar electronic part number.
- Identify common 74LS-series logic-gate part numbers.
- Recognize common integrated-circuit package styles.

# Section 2: Unknown Part Numbers

## Purpose

Digital designers often encounter unfamiliar part numbers. A part number can provide clues about the component family, manufacturer, package, temperature range, and function.

Use the internet to identify the function and one manufacturer for each part number below. You do not need to print datasheets for this section.

## Required Part Numbers

- `DM74LS00`
- `SN74LS02`
- `DM74LS75`
- `SN74LS86`
- `MAN6760`

## Deliverable

Recreate and complete the following table in your PLTW Engineering Notebook.

| Part Number | IC Name or Function | One Manufacturer |
|---|---|---|
| `DM74LS00` | Quad 2 Input NAND Gate | Fairchild Semiconductor |
| `SN74LS02` | Quad 2 input positive nor gate | Texas Instruments |
| `DM74LS75` | Quad Latch | Fairchild Semiconductor |
| `SN74LS86` | Quad 2-Input Exclusive OR Gate | Texas Intruments |
| `MAN6760` | 0.560-INCH SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAYS | Fairchild Semiconductor |

## Research Notes

When identifying a part:

- Search the complete part number rather than only the numeric portion.
- Prefer a manufacturer datasheet or manufacturer product page.
- Verify that the part function matches the complete part number.
- Record only one manufacturer, even if multiple companies have manufactured compatible versions.

# Section 3: Logic Gate Symbols and 74LS Part Numbers

## Purpose

Logic gates are available in many input configurations. Use the internet to identify the standard gate symbol and a corresponding 74LS-series part number for each gate type listed below.

Do not print datasheets for this section. View manufacturer datasheets or reliable component references online and extract the needed information.

## Required Gates

- 3-input AND gate
- 3-input NAND gate
- 4-input AND gate
- 4-input NAND gate
- 3-input NOR gate

## Deliverable

Recreate and complete the following table in your PLTW Engineering Notebook.

| Gate Name or Function | Gate Symbol | 74LS Series Part Number |
|---|---|---|
| 3-input AND gate | ___ | 74LS11 |
| 3-input NAND gate | ___ | 74LS10 |
| 4-input AND gate | ___ | 74LS21 |
| 4-input NAND gate | ___ | 74LS20 |

<!-- IMAGE: Standard AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and NOT gate symbols -->

## Helpful Reminder

A small circle, called an **inversion bubble**, on the input or output of a logic-gate symbol indicates logical inversion.

For example:

- An AND gate with an inverted output is a NAND gate.
- An OR gate with an inverted output is a NOR gate.
